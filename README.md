# Booking.com
In the digital age, the way people plan and organise travel has changed dramatically, pivoting from physical agencies to online platforms. 

This project, "Booking.com," is an innovative application designed to simplify the often-tedious process of planning a trip. 

The application serves as a comprehensive travel assistant, allowing users to book hotels and airfare without the need to navigate through multiple websites and platforms. 

The primary objective is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and all-encompassing platform that serves travellers' key needs during trip planning and booking.
